A simple command-line based Recipe Book built using Python.  
This project allows users to **add**, **view**, **edit**, **delete**, and **list** recipes stored in a text file.

---

## 📌 Features

- ➕ Add new recipes  
- 📖 View recipe by title  
- 🗑️ Delete recipe by title  
- ✏️ Edit recipe  
- 📃 List all saved recipe titles  
- 📁 All data is stored in a text file (`recipe.txt`)

## 💡 How It Works

Each recipe contains:
- A **Title**
- **Ingredients**
- The actual **Recipe** steps

These entries are saved in a consistent format using separators (`=====================`), allowing easy retrieval using `regex`.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- ✅ Python (CLI)
- ✅ File Handling
- ✅ Regular Expressions (`re`)
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming
